##Deribit TWAP Arbitrage
In crypto options markets, particularly on Deribit, the final settlement value of an expiring option is not based on a single snapshot of the underlying asset price but rather on a 30-minute time-weighted average price (TWAP) of the BTC index. This structural design creates a window of potential inefficiency: as expiry approaches, market participants begin to anchor option prices to the anticipated TWAP, rather than to short-term fluctuations in the spot price. This project captures and visualizes that dynamic by scraping live BTC call option prices from Deribit and simultaneously computing a real-time rolling TWAP of the BTC index—mimicking Deribit's actual settlement mechanism. The resulting chart reveals a predictable convergence between the live option market price and the TWAP-implied intrinsic value, particularly in the final 10–15 minutes before expiration. By quantifying this gap, traders can identify short-lived arbitrage opportunities—for instance, when a live option is underpriced relative to its expected TWAP settlement value. This methodology exposes a subtle but actionable inefficiency at the intersection of market structure and expiration pricing mechanics.
